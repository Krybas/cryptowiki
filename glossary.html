            <h2>A</h2>
            <p><span>Altcoin. </span>Any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin.</p>
            <p><span>ASIC. </span>An acronym that stands for an application-specific integrated circuit. An ASIC is a powerful and expensive computing device used for mining cryptocurrency.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="B">
            <h2>B</h2>
            <p><span>Bitcoin (BTC). </span>The original, largest and best-known cryptocurrency.</p>
            <p><span>Buy the dip. </span>An investing strategy involves buying an asset when its price has fallen to reap the benefits when its price rises again.</p>
            <p><span>Blockchain. </span>The underlying technology is used by nearly all cryptocurrencies. A blockchain is essentially a complete ledger of transactions held simultaneously by multiple nodes on a network.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="C">
            <h2>C</h2>
            <p><span>Coin. </span>A colloquial term for a cryptocurrency.</p>
            <p><span>Buy the dip. </span>An investing strategy involves buying an asset when its price has fallen to reap the benefits when its price rises again.</p>
            <p><span>Cold wallet. </span>A physical storage device such as a flash drive, hard drive or “solid state” drive used to store cryptocurrency offline.</p>
            <p><span>Cryptocurrency. </span>A digital asset that can be used as a store of value or a medium of exchange for goods and services. Transactions are verified and recorded using cryptography by a distributed network of participants, rather than a centralized authority such as a bank or government agency.</p>
            <p><span>cryptography. </span>A method of keeping information secret and secure by scrambling it into indecipherable codes. The information can only be decrypted and read with the necessary key.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="D">
            <h2>D</h2>
            <p><span>dApp. </span>Short for decentralized application, a dApp is an app that isn't controlled by a central authority. Twitter is an example of a centralized app, with users relying on it as an intermediary to send and receive messages. A dApp is distributed on a blockchain, allowing users to send and receive data directly without an intermediary.</p>
            <p><span>Defi. </span>Short for decentralized finance. Finance is traditionally centralized because it relies on trusted intermediaries. For example, if you want to send money to a friend or relative, you rely on your bank to send it to the recipient's bank. DeFi, on the other hand, requires no intermediaries. Participants can send and receive assets directly. In theory, this makes transactions faster and cheaper.</p>
            <p><span>DAO. </span>An acronym that stands for a decentralized autonomous organization. A DAO is a group of people who work together toward a shared goal and abide by rules written into the project's self-executing computer code. Bitcoin (the project, not the currency) is the earliest example of a DAO.</p>
            <p><span>Distributed ledger. </span> In traditional finance, an organization such as a bank holds a ledger of all its customers' transactions. Distributed ledges use nodes, or independent computers, to record, share, synchronize transactions on the electronic ledger. A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger.</p>
            <p><span>Double spend. </span>If you spend $5 in cash to pay for a sandwich, you no longer own the $5 and cannot spend it a second time. Even with digital transactions, centralized authorities, such as banks, only permit people to spend their money one time. With decentralized financial tokens like cryptocurrencies, a single coin could be copied 100 times and spent 100 times. Blockchain helps solve and prevent this double-spend problem.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="E">
            <h2>E</h2>
            <p><span>Exchange. </span>A Website or app that allows uers to buy and sell crypto assets.</p>
            <p><span>Ether (ETH). </span>The native cryptocurrency token of the Ethereum platform.</p>
            <p><span>Ethereum. </span>The second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin.</p>
            <p><span>Encryption. </span>The process of making digital information into a form that prevents unauthorized access. If you use a password to access a website, the site should be encrypting it so that it is of no use to hackers if stolen.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="F">
            <h2>F</h2>
            <p><span>Fiat currency. </span>Traditional currencies are backed by the full faith and credit of a nation state. The U.S. dollar, the euro or the British pound are fiat currencies.</p>
            <p><span>Fork. </span>The process by which the community that runs an individual cryptocurrency makes a change to the blockchain’s governing protocols. The change marks a major departure—a fork, if you will—from the previous iteration of the blockchain. Soft forks typically involve a change in the software protocol, but one that is backwards-compatible. Hard forks are significant enough to require all nodes to upgrade to the latest version.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="G">
            <h2>G</h2>
            <p><span>Gas. </span>Transactions on the Ethereum network carry a fee. For every transaction, users must pay an amount of the native Ethereum currency, Ether (ETH). This fee is referred to as gas. Gas is used to reward Ethereum validators for the energy they use clearing transactions. Gas also serves as a deterrent against malicious use of the blockchain.</p>
            <p><span>Genesis block. </span>The first block in a blockchain. The genesis block is hardcoded into the software of the cryptocurrency and is the only block that does not reference a previous block.</p>
            <p><span>Graphics card. </span>Verifying transactions on a blockchain via proof of work involves solving cryptographic puzzles. Solving these puzzles may require significant computing power, which in turn may consume substantial amounts of power. High-end graphics cards used in PC gaming have the processing power needed to validate transactions.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="H">
            <h2>H</h2>
            <p><span>Halving. </span>Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins. Every four years, the number of new bitcoins created and earned by miners is cut in half. This event is known as the halving. The most recent halving occurred in May 2020.</p>
            <p><span>Hash. </span>A hash is the result of a piece of data being put through a special hashing algorithm. It compresses data into a nearly unique alphanumeric string of text. This is important in cryptocurrency because a blockchain is an immutable record of transactions, and hashing  can uncover attempts to illegitimately alter or change data.</p>
            <p><span>Hash rate. </span>The speed at which a computer can perform an operation in a given amount of time. In cryptocurrency, the hash rate is the speed at which a computer can solve a complex mathematical problem. The higher the hash rate, the more likely a miner is to solve the problem and receive a reward.</p>
            <p><span>Hot wallet. </span>A form of online storage for cryptocurrencies, provided either by an exchange or a third party. Since storage is online and accessed with passwords, hot wallets are typically a target for hackers. However, hot wallet operators can help users regain access to their assets if they lose their access codes.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="I">
            <h2>I</h2>
            <p><span>ICO. </span>An acronym that stands for initial coin offering. An ICO is the cryptocurrency equivalent of an initial public offering (IPO). It offers investors the opportunity to back a new crypto project.</p>
            <p><span>Immutable. </span>Once a transaction is recorded on a blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. This is because the blockchain is a decentralized network of computers that all hold a copy of the ledger. If one computer tries to alter the ledger, the other computers will reject the change.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="J">
            <h2>J</h2>
            <p><span>Jackpot. </span>When a miner successfully solves a block, they are rewarded with a jackpot of cryptocurrency. The jackpot is the sum of the transaction fees and the block reward.</p>
            <p><span>Jager. </span>The smallest denomination of Binance Coin (BNB).</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="K">
            <h2>K</h2>
            <p><span>Know Your Customer (KYC). </span> Although not required, many crypto exchanges carry out certain identity checks on their customers under KYC rules.</p>
            <p><span>Key. </span> A string of characters that allows you to access your cryptocurrency. A private key is used to access your wallet, while a public key is used to receive funds.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="L">
            <h2>L</h2>
            <p><span>Ledger. </span>A record of transactions maintained by both centralized financial institutions and decentralized finance applications.  Data for each transaction entered into a ledger may include times, dates, senders and recipients.</p>
            <p><span>Leverage. </span>When a trader borrows money to increase their position in a trade, they are using leverage. Leverage can amplify gains, but it can also amplify losses.</p>
            <p><span>Liquidity. </span>The ease with which an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its price. High liquidity means an asset can be bought or sold quickly without a significant change in price.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="M">
            <h2>M</h2>
            <p><span>Meme coin. </span>An altcoin based on a meme, a kind of inside joke in the form of an image repeatedly altered and shared online. Dogecoin is an example of a meme coin.</p>
            <p><span>Miner. </span>A person or entity that verifies transactions on a blockchain. Miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency for their efforts.</p>
            <p><span>Mining. </span>Crypto mining is the process of verifying transactions via a proof of work consensus mechanism. Mining involves using computer hardware to solve a hash with trillions of possible combinations. The more computing power you have, the more guesses you can make within each given window of time, and the greater your chances of earning newly minted crypto.</p>
            <p><span>Market cap. </span>The total value of a cryptocurrency in circulation. It is calculated by multiplying the current price of a single coin by the total number of coins in circulation.</p>
            <p><span>Market capitalization. </span> Also written as market cap, this is the total market value of a cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, all cryptocurrencies had a combined market cap of slightly less than $1 trillion.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="N">
            <h2>N</h2>
            <p><span>Node. </span>A computer that connects to a blockchain network. Nodes are responsible for validating transactions and maintaining the blockchain's security.</p>
            <p><span>Nonce. </span>A number that miners must find to create a new block. The nonce is a random number that miners must find to create a new block. It is combined with the block's data and hashed. If the hash meets the criteria set by the network, the block is added to the blockchain.</p>
            <p><span>NFT. </span>An acronym that stands for a non-fungible token, a digital collectible that uses the same underlying technology as cryptocurrencies.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="O">
            <h2>O</h2>
            <p><span>On-chain. </span>A transaction that occurs on a blockchain, reflected on the distributed, public ledger.</p>
            <p><span>On-ledger currency. </span>A cryptocurrency that is minted by and used on a blockchain ledger, such as Bitcoin.</p>
            <p><span>Orphan block</span> A block that has been solved but accepted by the network and isn't added to the blockchain. Sometimes these blocks are referred to as "stale block".</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="P">
            <h2>P</h2>
            <p><span>Peer to peer (P2P)</span>Refers to a transaction between two people without an intermediary or central authority involved.</p>
            <p><span>Private key. </span>This is essentially the encrypted password to someone's crypto holdings. It's an impossibly long number that's practically impossible to guess. You authorize a transaction by signing it with your private key. Private keys can be used to access and manage your crypto assets.</p>
            <p><span>Public key. </span>The public-facing address of your crypto wallet. To receive funds into your account, you have to share your public key. Each public key pairs with a private key, and the private key is only known, in theory, to that user.</p>
            <p><span>Proof of work (PoW). </span>This is a consensus mechanism employed by many blockchains to prove that miners have done the computational work to guess the 64-character hash necessary to add a block to the blockchain. Broadcasting the solution allows other nodes to quickly verify that your hash is correct and that you have carried out the work required to get it.</p>
            <p><span>Proof of stake (PoS).</span>This is a consensus mechanism employed by some blockchains that requires verifiers to lock up, or stake, a certain amount of cryptocurrency to earn a chance to add new blocks to a blockchain. The more coins you stake, the better your chances of becoming a validator. Should you spend your way into the position to deliberately approve a fraudulent transaction, you risk losing your stake, providing a strong disincentive to cheat.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Q">
            <h2>Q</h2>
            <p><span>QR code. </span>Short for quick response code, a QR code is a two-dimensional barcode that can be scanned by a smartphone camera to quickly and easily transfer information.</p>
            <p><span>Quantum computing. </span>A computer science field that uses principles of quantum physics to process much larger data sets at much greater speeds than traditional computing methods.</p>
